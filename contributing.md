# Contributing to mhvdb2

Please make your own fork the repository and use pull requests to submit
changes. This lets [TravisCi](https://travis-ci.org/makehackvoid/mhvdb2) check
for errors before the changes are committed to master.

## Use issues to organise work

So that other people know what you are working on, either assign an existing
issue to yourself or create a new issue and then assign it. Ask if you don't
have access or need help doing this. Reference the issue number #nn in the pull
request when you have something ready to share (this lets Github link back to
the issue automatically).

## Running mhvdb2 locally

Use `python runserver.py` to start the mhvdb2 [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
application.

## Unit tests

We are using [TravisCi](https://travis-ci.org/makehackvoid/mhvdb2) to run tests
whenever a pull request is submitted or a commit is made. Please update or add
new tests as you make changes. Tests are held in the `./tests/` subdirectory. You
can run the tests locally by using `python runtests.py` in the main project
directory.

## PEP8 compliance

[TravisCi](https://travis-ci.org/makehackvoid/mhvdb2) is now checking pep8 and
PyFlakes compliance before running the application tests using flake8. The
`setup.cfg` includes the settings for flake8 - at this stage just that lines
can be up to 99 characters instead of the default 80. You can install flake8
locally using `pip install flake8` or your editor may have a flake8 plugin.

## Documentation

We are using [Sphinx](http://http://sphinx-doc.org/) for documentation. You can
install sphinx locally using `pip install sphinx`.

## Python virtual environment

To get a python3 virtualenvwrapper project I installed python3 (and
virtualenvwrapper), checked where it was using `which python3` then told
virtualenvwrapper to use that python by setting `export
VIRTUALENV_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3` then if you don't already have a
project directory, use `mkproject mhvdb2` to create it or, if it already
exists, change to the project directory and use

```sh
mkvirtualenv mhvdb2
setvirtualenvproject
```

Once it is setup, to stop defaulting to python3, unset the python env variable
using `unset VIRTUALENV_PYTHON`

This has left my old environments using python 2.7 and the new one using 3.4.1

## Install required packages

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Git remotes for testing

Fork the repository to your own account so that you can make pull requests.
Clone it to your computer.

On your computer add a new remote 'upstream' so you can update your fork from
the original makehackvoid project. If you want to be able to see (fetch) and
pull down pull requests from the original makehackvoid project for testing, add
a second fetch line to `.git/config` 

```gitconfig
fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*
```

In .git/config I have:

```gitconfig
[remote "upstream"]
    url   = https://github.com/makehackvoid/mhvdb2.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*
    fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream/pr/*
```
